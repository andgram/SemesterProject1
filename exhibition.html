              <h3>Evolution</h3>
              <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come
                from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for
                exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can
                also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the
                Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

              <h3>Biology and Medicine</h3>
              <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into
                the great wonders of the tiny world.
                For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the
                growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and
                take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart
                transplant.
                Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in
                the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

              <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the future.
                From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say
                hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.</p>

              <h3>Ecology</h3>
              <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that
                scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.</p>

              <h3>Cosmology</h3>
              <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and
                what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies
                that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
                Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest
                exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

            <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community
              Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements
              as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able
              to use and control wind to create power.</p>
